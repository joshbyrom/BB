Block Buster

Description
----------------

A block busting game with a unique twist.


Information
----------------

This repository contains some of the logic for the game Block Buster being developed over at http://code.google.com/p/blockbuster-daveottley/ by Dave Ottley. Until the engine is ready, I will be using Matt Buckland's simulation window and utility code from his AI book to test my code and logic.

Ultimately we will be migrating away from his code base, but if you are interested in his work, you can check out his site here http://www.ai-junkie.com/


Notes

This software uses a high performance timer that is not found on older CPU's!
